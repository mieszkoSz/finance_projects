To run all of the projects in sequence from project 1 to 3 use command python run_projects.py

Make sure all of the required libraries across of all of the .py files are installed on the device.

To run just individual projects either modify run_projects.py (advised) or add rune_code(**args) line in specific project files and
run those files directly from command line.

Files already present in the directory are only a small amount of combinations that can be generated to explore more
change the arguments in run_code() calls especially country codes / names or plot_type as descirbed in run_projects.py
